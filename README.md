this is a JDBC project which functions as a pharmaceutical management system 
hi there , so what u r looking at is a medical store system done with the help of java , dbms , mysql , JDBC .
RUNNING PART :
So download the zip file and extarct tehm into ur pc and create a new java project in eclipse or netbeansin ur pc and copy the java files into that new project in eclipse and 
also copy paste the images folder for the symbols of icons in our system .
and then u have to open mysql and create a database and tables accordingly but need not worry i gave a sql file so download that and run the sql file in mysql.
i have mentioned sql parts with using comments in the sql file including the specifications.
CONNECTIVITY :
now to connect the database and the java files u need to download the connector , for that u need to search in google as following :
download mysql java connector 
and click the first link saying maven 
and then add that connector to ur build path in the java project files ...
thank you and have a good day .
